fr_mlg: Includes Hu-Sawicki [0705.1158] f(R) gravity spectra
gr_mlg: Includes general relativity spectra
Skewed: Further data set with lower modification in the f(R) data and less GR data examples. 


Columns of data files: 

Wave mode k [h/Mpc]  | Linear Power Spectrum P(k) |  Linear No-Wiggle spectrum  P_NW(k)

The No-wiggle spectrum has removed the baryon acoustic oscillation feature from P(k). 

All data was produced using ReACT : https://github.com/nebblu/ReACT


The fr_mlg and gr_mlg text files include the cosmology of each spectrum example with columns:

Example number |  Omega_matter | Omega_baryons | Hubble constant | spectral tilt n_s | amplitude of density fluctuations sigma_8 | f(R) parameter fr_0 | - | - |
